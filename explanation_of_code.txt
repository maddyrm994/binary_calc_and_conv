  (ii) If an invalid number is entered, it alerts the user.

2. Binary Calculator:
  (i) The calculateBinary function validates if both inputs are binary.
  (ii) It converts binary numbers to decimal, performs the selected arithmetic operation, and converts the result back to binary.
  (iii) Division uses Math.floor for integer results and includes a check to prevent division by zero.
  
3. User Interface:
  (i) HTML elements are organized with headings and sections for clarity.
  (ii) CSS styling enhances readability and provides a user-friendly interface.
  (iii) This app is an educational tool for learning about binary and base conversions while exploring how arithmetic works with binary numbers.
